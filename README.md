# OpenPrintHQ Vault

A fork of [GyroidVault](https://github.com/TeeCodeDev/GyroidVault) by TeeCodeDev,
the model library behind the Files section of OpenPrintHQ. AGPL-3.0, as upstream
is, and upstream history is preserved so changes can be merged in both
directions.

**What differs from upstream:** this fork does not authenticate anyone. Identity
comes from Authentik through OpenPrintHQ, every API route and every file served
requires it, and the login, registration, invite, password-reset and API-key
machinery is gone. See [docs/authentication.md](docs/authentication.md).

**It also has no frontend.** `public/` is deleted. The library's screens are
native OpenPrintHQ pages now, served from the app's own origin and calling this
API through it, so what is left here is the API, the scanner and the file
serving. Upstream's frontend documentation below therefore describes something
this fork does not ship.

**Pulling upstream changes in** is a merge, not a port: upstream history and
SHAs are intact on purpose. The procedure, the four files that conflict every
time, and the checks to run before building are in
[docs/upstream-sync.md](docs/upstream-sync.md).

Everything below is upstream's README, kept for reference on how the library
itself works.

**GyroidVault** is a fast, self-hosted 3D model vault and slicing workspace built for 3D printing enthusiasts, makers, and print farm owners. Organize your STL, 3MF, STEP, and G-Code files on your own hardware, inspect multi-part assemblies in a calm 3D studio, measure exact physical dimensions in millimeters, and send slices directly to your printers.

## What's New in v2.0.0

- 🧩 **Multi-Part 3D Assembly:** Render all STL and 3MF parts together on the virtual build plate in contrasting colors, or inspect them one by one.
- 📐 **Real Physical Dimensions:** See the exact size in millimeters (`W × D × H mm`) right in the 3D header before firing up your slicer.
- ⚡ **Background Scanner for 2TB+ Libraries:** Non-blocking indexing that runs in the background with live progress counters and memory safety guards for giant folders.
- 🎨 **2-Column Studio Workspace:** A clean, distraction-free layout with a full-size 3D viewport, Markdown notes, slicing specs, and print history tabs.
- 📚 **2x2 Collection Collages & 1-Click ZIP:** Visual grid previews for folders and direct ZIP downloads straight to your browser.
- 🛡️ **Under-the-Hood Security:** Stronger access control on private collections, path traversal defenses, parameterized queries, and login rate limiting.
- 🚀 **1-Click Slicer Integration:** Launch models directly into Bambu Studio, PrusaSlicer, OrcaSlicer, or Elegoo Slicer.

## Core Features

- **3D Interactive Studio:** Smooth WebGL rendering for STL and 3MF files with isometric presets, wireframe, X-ray inspection, and 1-click thumbnail snapshot generation (`Cover`).
- **Interactive G-Code Previewer:** Inspect toolpaths layer by layer with live layer counts, Z-heights, auto-centered camera framing, and nozzle/bed temperature readouts.
- **Scale Ready for 2TB+ Libraries:** Optimized SQLite indexing and throttled batch disk writes handle tens of thousands of models without UI lag or memory exhaustion.
- **Moonraker & Klipper Integration:** Connect your 3D printers and upload sliced G-Code files straight to your printer with a single click.
- **Power Batch Editing:** `Ctrl+Click` or `Shift+Click` to select dozens of models at once for bulk tagging, category re-assignment, or collection grouping.
- **Folder Watching & Direct Browsing:** Point GyroidVault to your existing 3D print folders on NAS/Unraid shares. It indexes non-destructively without forcing strange directory structures.
- **Duplicate File Finder:** Scans your library with SHA-256 hashes to uncover identical copies eating up drive space.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Admin, Uploader, and Viewer permissions. Keep private collections safe while letting family or team members browse read-only.
- **Expiring Public Share Links:** Generate secure, timed links to share specific models without giving access to your entire library.
- **Custom Metadata Fields:** Add custom key-value pairs (designer, license, print orientation notes, nozzle size) tailored to your workflow.

## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

The recommended installation method is using Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  gyroidvault:
    image: ghcr.io/teecodedev/gyroidvault:latest
    container_name: gyroidvault
    ports:
      - "3457:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
      - /path/to/your/3dprints:/library
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - PORT=3000
      - LIBRARY_PATH=/library
    restart: unless-stopped
```

1. Replace `/path/to/your/3dprints` with the directory path where your 3D files live.
2. Start the service:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3457` (or your server IP).

> 💡 **Unraid Users:** GyroidVault is available directly in the Unraid Community Applications store. Search for `GyroidVault` to install with pre-configured templates!

## Initial Setup

### 1. Register the Administrator
The first user account created on a fresh GyroidVault installation is automatically promoted to **Administrator**. No invite code is required for the initial setup.

### 2. Optional: Configure SMTP Mail
To enable password recovery and email invites:
1. Log in as **Administrator**.
2. Go to **Settings** → **SMTP & Mail**.
3. Fill in your SMTP host, port, credentials, and from-address, then click **Send Test Email**.

### 3. Connect Moonraker / Klipper Printers
1. Go to **Settings** → **Printers**.
2. Add your printer name, Moonraker HTTP URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.50:7125`), and optional API key.
3. You can now send G-Code files straight to your printer from any model detail page!

## Manual Installation (Without Docker)

For running directly on bare metal or custom homelab environments:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TeeCodeDev/GyroidVault.git
cd GyroidVault

# 2. Install dependencies (Node.js 18+ required)
npm install

# 3. Setup configuration
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Start the server
npm start
```

## Security & Privacy
 
- **100% Local & Self-Hosted:** Everything lives on your own storage in a lightweight SQLite database. No mandatory cloud accounts, no third-party trackers, no telemetry.
- **Strict Path Confinement:** File reads and uploads stay strictly inside your configured `LIBRARY_PATH` — no directory escaping.
- **Brute-Force Protection:** Rate limiting on logins and sensitive actions. Malicious IPs are temporarily blocked and can be inspected or unblocked from admin settings.
- **Session Tokens & Safe Queries:** Parameterized database queries and securely generated session secrets keep your vault private.

---

## Slicer URL Handlers

GyroidVault supports direct file launching into major slicers via desktop URI protocols:
- **Bambu Studio:** `bambustudio://`
- **PrusaSlicer:** `prusaslicer://`
- **OrcaSlicer:** `orcaslicer://`

Make sure your slicer has URL protocol registration enabled in its system preferences.
