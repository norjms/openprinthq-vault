# OpenPrintHQ Vault

A fork of [GyroidVault](https://github.com/TeeCodeDev/GyroidVault) by TeeCodeDev,
the model library behind the Files section of OpenPrintHQ. AGPL-3.0, as upstream
is, and upstream history is preserved so changes can be merged in both
directions.

**What differs from upstream:** this fork does not authenticate anyone. Identity
comes from Authentik through OpenPrintHQ, every API route and every file served
requires it, and the login, registration, invite, password-reset and API-key
machinery is gone. See [docs/authentication.md](docs/authentication.md).

**It also has no frontend.** `public/` is deleted. The library's screens are
native OpenPrintHQ pages now, served from the app's own origin and calling this
API through it, so what is left here is the API, the scanner and the file
serving. Upstream's frontend documentation below therefore describes something
this fork does not ship.

**Pulling upstream changes in** is a merge, not a port: upstream history and
SHAs are intact on purpose. The procedure, the four files that conflict every
time, and the checks to run before building are in
[docs/upstream-sync.md](docs/upstream-sync.md).

Everything below is upstream's README, kept for reference on how the library
itself works.

# GyroidVault

**GyroidVault** is a self-hosted 3D model library and print manager. It helps you organize your STL, 3MF, and Gcode files, keep track of your print history, and group files into project collections.

## Features

- **Dark/Light Mode & Themes**: Toggle between dark and light themes, and choose from multiple application themes (e.g., Glass) depending on your preference.
- **Interactive 3D G-Code Previewer**: Inspect parsed G-code layer by layer with live layer numbers, Z-heights, auto-centered camera framing, dynamic build volume grids, and filament color matching.
- **IP Auto-Block & Security Control**: Monitor rate-limited IP addresses from failed login attempts and unblock them with 1-click in the dedicated Security settings tab.
- **Duplicate File Finder**: Scan your 3D model library using SHA-256 file hashes to locate identical 3D models across your collection.
- **Batch Actions**: Use `Ctrl+Click` (or `Shift+Click`) to select multiple models in the grid to bulk tag, delete, or add to collections at once.
- **Folder Watching**: Automatically scan your local directories to import models, or upload them manually.
- **Folder View Collages**: Browse your local directories directly. Folders automatically generate dynamic 2x2 image collages based on the 3D files inside them.
- **Built-in 3D Viewer**: Preview STL and 3MF files directly in your browser.
- **Extended G-Code Analysis**: Extract deep metadata from your G-Code files including infill, layers, temperatures, volumetric speed, print cost, and the slicer/printer used.
- **Moonraker / Klipper Integration**: Configure your printers and seamlessly send G-Code files directly to your printer with one click.
- **Custom Meta Boxes**: Add and manage custom metadata fields for your models for ultimate flexibility.
- **Collections**: Group related files together for multi-part projects.
- **Model Versioning**: Track design iterations (v1, v2, final) under a single model entry.
- **Print Log**: Keep a history of your prints, filament types used, and success rates.
- **Public Share Links**: Generate secure, expiring links to share specific models with others.
- **1-Click Slicer Integration**: Set your "Preferred Slicer" in your profile to instantly send files to Bambu Studio, PrusaSlicer, OrcaSlicer, or Elegoo Slicer.
- **Multi-User & Roles (RBAC)**: Assign roles (Admin, Uploader, Viewer) to restrict access. Viewers get a clean, read-only interface with hidden action buttons.

## Quick Start (Docker Compose)

The easiest way to get GyroidVault running is using Docker Compose.

1. **Create a file** named `docker-compose.yml`:
    ```yaml
    services:
      gyroidvault:
        image: ghcr.io/teecodedev/gyroidvault:latest
        container_name: gyroidvault
        ports:
          - "3457:3000"
        volumes:
          - ./data:/app/data
          - /path/to/your/3dprints:/library
        environment:
          - NODE_ENV=production
          - PORT=3000
          - LIBRARY_PATH=/library
        restart: unless-stopped
    ```

2. **Configure your library**: Replace `/path/to/your/3dprints` with the path on your host machine where your models are stored.

3. **Start the container**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4. **Open in browser**:
    Go to [http://localhost:3457](http://localhost:3457) in your browser.

## Initial Setup

### 1. Registering the Admin
The very first person to register on a new GyroidVault instance automatically becomes the Administrator.
- You do not need an invite code for the first registration.
- If you are prompted for an invite code on a fresh install, make sure your `./data` directory is empty.

### 2. Configuring SMTP (Email)
To enable password resets and user invitations, you need to configure SMTP:
1. Log in as the **Administrator**.
2. Go to **Settings** > **SMTP & Mail**.
3. Enter your SMTP server details (Host, Port, User, Password).
4. Save and test the configuration.

## Manual Installation

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+).
2. Clone this repo and run `npm install`.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your settings.
4. Run `npm start`.

## Security & Privacy

- **Local SQLite Database**: Your data stays on your own hardware. No external cloud database or telemetry is forced.
- **Admin Control**: The first registered user automatically becomes the Admin. Invited users need token codes.
- **Advanced API Security**: Uses secure `HttpOnly` cookies for authentication, double-submit CSRF protection, and strict rate-limiting on login endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.
- **File Management**: Uploaded files are kept locally in the database/uploads structure.

## Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Issues
- **Viewer not loading**: Make sure your browser supports WebGL and that you are not using an ad-blocker that blocks Three.js components.
- **File scanning issues**: Verify that your `LIBRARY_PATH` or the volume mapping in Docker is correct and that the app has read permissions for that directory.
- **Slicer links not opening**: Make sure the slicer (Bambu Studio, etc.) is installed and has registered its URL scheme on your OS.
- 💡 **Mac / Apple Silicon Users**: If GyroidVault doesn't respond on `http://localhost:3457/` after starting the container, try navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:3457/` instead. This is a common Docker networking quirk on Mac OSX!

### Support
- **Unraid Users**: Please use the dedicated support thread on the Unraid Forums.
- **General Issues**: Open an issue on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TeeCodeDev/GyroidVault/issues).
